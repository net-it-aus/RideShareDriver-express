        <h1>How to enjoy the Ride Share experience</h1>

        ride-share
        rideshare
        ...participate in an arrangement in which a passenger travels in a private vehicle driven by its owner for a fee especially as arranged by means of a website or app:
        "riders place a request to ride-share by setting a pick-up and drop-off location via the app".

        <h1>Riders guide</h1>
        <p>To fully enjoy the Ride Share experience might mean that you cannot 'be yourself' when sharing a ride with a Ride Share Driver.</p>
        <p>You will need to follow some rules (local laws) and we recommend considering the following when using a Ride Share service.</p>
        <p>A Ride Share vehicle is an expensive asset. Please follow the Driver's instructions before, during and at the end of the Ride.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Treat everyone with respect</li>
                <ul>
